# 1. load the ebola1976 data from the `{cfr}` package, as in lab_2.qmd, but redefine cases column as `primary` and deaths column as `secondary`.






# 2. EpiNow2 has the capability to `estimate_secondary`;
# investigate its use, then apply it to the Ebola data through Oct 1



# 3. Use that estimate with the `forecast_secondary` capability, now providing the rest of the primary series







# Hint: consult the examples from ?EpiNow2::estimate_secondary
