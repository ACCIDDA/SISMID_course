# 1. load the UK covid data, as in lab_1.qmd, but this time do not filter it by date



# 2. use `{incidence2}` to aggregate to daily counts



# 3. Plot the data in way that you can identify two distinct periods,
# one of decline and one of growth





# 4. Extract those periods, then use `{i2extras}` to calculate growth during each
