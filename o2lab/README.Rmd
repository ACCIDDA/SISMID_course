**Welcome to the outbreak reconstruction lab!**

We are excited to have you join this two-part lab (Lab 3 and 4 of *R Tools for Rapid Outbreak Analytics*) focused on outbreak reconstruction using the `outbreaker2` package.

**Before the first session**, please ensure you have completed the pre-course videos and readings, and that your R environment is fully set up. All required materials can be found on the [Canvas site](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/11724282).

**During the live sessions**, we will work through practical outbreak reconstruction exercises using Quarto (`.qmd`) files, based on a simulated Ebola outbreak.

**Exercises** marked with the ðŸ§  symbol indicate collaborative tasks that will be completed together during the sessions. You are welcome to review the `.qmd` files and attempt the exercises in advance, though this is not required.

If you have any questions ahead of the sessions, please post them on Canvas so we can address them during the live discussions.

Do not hesitate to get in touch if you need further support.

Best regards,

Cy
