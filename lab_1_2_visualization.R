# 1. create a synthetic line list, sim_data, as in lab_1.qmd





# 2. Aggregate `sim_data` by admission date, case outcome, and sex in 2-week windows (i.e. biweekly)








# 3. Plot the biweekly incidence, faceted by outcome, and distinguishing by sex within panels



# 4 BONUS: Polish up the plot; e.g. make the date break grid on months, relabel axes














# 3. perform the calculation and make a simple plot!









# 4. BONUS: identify the unlikely values, systematically correct or exclude them, and make a new plot
