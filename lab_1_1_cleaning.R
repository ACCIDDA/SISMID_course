# 1. load the raw_ebola_data, as in lab_1.qmd






# 2. using `{cleanepi}` clean up the data enough to:
#   - calculate the distribution of times from onset to sample ...
#   - for females over age 20 ...
#   - including where onset to sample is negative

# hint: think what data are needed and what cleaning steps are necessary














# 3. perform the calculation and make a simple plot!









# 4. BONUS: identify the unlikely values, systematically correct or exclude them, and make a new plot
